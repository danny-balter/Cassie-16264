The purpose of Cassie is to act as a journal keeping therapy/companion robot for any user who needs one. It is also capable of dialing 9-1-1 for those who are determined to be threats to themselves or others.

Assignment 1:

Currently Cassie is capable of hearing instructions, talking to you basically, recognizing those who are going to harm or kill themselves, and temporarily storing a journal entry (permanant storage will be added tomorrow). This uses google's voice recognition software and a python library for speaking to the user in a "human-like" voice.
