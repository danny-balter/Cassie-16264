The purpose of Cassie is to act as a journal keeping therapy/companion robot for any user who needs one. It is also capable of dialing 9-1-1 for those who are determined to be threats to themselves or others.

Assignment 1:

For our assignment 1, we began implementing Cassie, a therapy robot
designed to recognize those who are dangers to themselves or others. The
first step was to get the google voice recognition library working, as well
as finding a python library to talk to user. Additionally, we implemented
some keywords to allow Cassie to recognize those who were going to harm
themselves. Finally, the ability to create temporary (soon to be
permanently saved and accessible) journal entries was added.

One thing that did not work was an attempt to make Cassie listen until a
keyword was said, and then omit that keyword from the final submission.
This will be resolved as more work is done on Cassie.

As we move forward the main thing we'd like to add is the ability for
Cassie to analyze and learn from your journal entries and customize her
interactions with user based on that. Additionally multi-user support, and
the ability to interact with other devices would be awesome.
